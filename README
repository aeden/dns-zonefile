DNS::Zonefile
=============

The format of a DNS Zonefile is defined in RFC 1035 section 5 and RFC
1034 section 3.6.1. To anyone who's using BIND they'll look very 
familiar.

This is an attempt to use Ruby parse them into an object graph which can 
be investigated programatically, manipulated, validated or printed into 
some canonical form.


Getting setup
-------------

Well, you'll need the treetop and polyglot gems installed. They do all 
the hard work. Thanks!

  sudo gem install treetop polyglot

Now you'll need to generate the Treetop parser from the Zonefile grammar 
that I've hacked together.

  rake generate_grammar

Okay, you're ready to move onto the examples now.

The above steps should not be necessary if you install the gem via rubygems.


Examples
--------

Using raw data from the parser. Note that "@" isn't translated in this mode.
Nor are inherited TTLs interpreted.

  zonefile = "/path/to/file.zone"
  zone_string = File.read(zonefile)
  zone = DNS::Zonefile.parse(zone_string)

  puts zone.soa.origin.to_s
  puts zone.soa.ns.to_s
  puts zone.rr[0].to_s

Using more structure data. @, TTLs, and empty hostname inheritance are all
handled in this mode.

  zonefile = "/path/to/file.zone"
  zone_string = File.read(zonefile)
  zone = DNS::Zonefile.load(zone_string)
  # or, if no $origin is in the zone file
  zone = DNS::Zonefile.load(zone_string, 'example.com.')

  puts zone.soa.origin
  puts zone.soa.nameserver
  puts zone.records[1]
  # get all MX records
  puts zone.records_of(DNS::MX)
